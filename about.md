Hello and thank you for visiting my page. My name is Anthony Keating and I'm a software developer. After graduating from Queens College in May 2011, I was very eager to get myself out there and start building the foundation for a fulfilling career out of something that I enjoyed. 

I spent three years working as a client manager at a reputable rental company before deciding to make a career change. I had always loved to code and was finally allowing that passion to take over.

Since then I've worked on many projects for work and for fun. I really enjoy learning new technologies and am always trying to improve my skills.

Make sure to check out my <a href='/projects/'>projects</a>. If you have any questions, please shoot me an e-mail. I'm always happy to answer a question, or read about a new opportunity. I look forward to hearing from you.
