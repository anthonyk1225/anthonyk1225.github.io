<br>
A classmate and I developed a web application using Django. You can search for stocks, given a date range anywhere from 10 years ago to present day. It takes the prices of the given range and plots it on a graph using D3 JS. You may then query your twitter list and it will plot those tweets, showing if there is any correlation between the two. Made use of Twitter, Quandl and Alchemy API.
