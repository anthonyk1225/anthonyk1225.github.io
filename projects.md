<h3>June 2016 - Present</h3>

This project was inspired from my own agonizing apartment search.
For years, I was faced with having to pay a fee for a real estate
agent. This is aimed to change renting an apartment easier for everyone.

I created the website autonomously. I use Django for the main framework, React for my
views and Postgres for the database. Check out some of
the website <a href='/candiddigs/'>here</a>.

I was approached by the owner of this gym, Jacinto. He had a wordpress website but
was looking for something that looked less like facebook. I met with him and we discussed
a good solution. 

I created the design and the actual website. I used Django as the main framework as well
as React for my views. Jacinto is able to add workouts everyday using the Django admin. 
Workouts are saved to the database which happens to be Postgres. 

Finally, I served the website using apache on a digital ocean droplet. Check out some of
the website <a href='/crossfit1939/'>here</a>.
