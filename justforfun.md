<br>
A classmate and I developed a web application using Django. You can search for stocks, given a date range anywhere from 10 years ago to present day. It takes the prices of the given range and plots it on a graph using D3. You can then query a twitter list and it will plot those tweets, displaying if there is any correlation between the two. Made use of Twitter, Quandl and Alchemy APIs. Hosted on heroku.
