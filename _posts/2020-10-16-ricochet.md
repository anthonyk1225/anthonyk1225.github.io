  <p>Ricochet is a 2D side-scrolling game. It was created with Lua on the Love framework and ported over to iOS.</p>
  <h3>iOS Rejection</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, apple is pretty strict when it comes to what apps they approve and reject. After submitting my app for review, apple gave me the hammer and rejected it.</p>
  <img src="/css/assets/images/ricochet/apple-rejection.png"/>
  <p>Perhaps one day, I'll be able to get it on the app store but until then, you can still play it on your desktop. All you need is <a href="https://love2d.org/">Love</a> installed. Download <a href="https://github.com/anthonyk1225/ricochet/blob/master/ricochet.love">this love file</a> and double click to start.</p>
  <h3>Testflight</h3>
  <p>The app is currently on testflight. If you're interested in playing for iOS, shoot me an email and I can add you as a tester.</p>

  <h3>Controls</h3>
  <p>The controls for desktop are pretty simple.</p>
  <h4>Commands</h4>
  <p>Press <strong>a</strong> to move left.</p>
  <p>Press <strong>d</strong> to move right.</p>
  <p>Press <strong>space bar</strong> to jump.</p>
  <p>Press <strong>l</strong> to shoot a projectile.</p>
  <p>When prompted, you will press <strong>n</strong> to start the game or restart the game.</p>

  <h3>Goal</h3>
  <p>Your goal of the game is to make it to the highest stage you can. Shoot slimes with your projectile, don't fall in a pit and don't let them touch you.</p>

  <p>I hope you like the game and welcome all feedback.</p>
